## What I built
I build Instagram AI bot. I use openAI for creating prompt and image. Bot will create new image every day and post it on Instagram. It will also upload image to Cloudinary as backup.
It's all run on Linode server as express app.

## Background
All that AI hype is crazy. I want to take a part so I decide to create art (maybe someone will like it). Let's see what new will bring us.


### How I built it
Linode is a great tool. I am still learning it. There is so many ways to use it. I watch some YouTube tutorials like this https://youtu.be/sD8X4CApdpo and they really help me to build it. 
Spoiler alert - it's super easy :)
